Elasticsearch/LogStash Field Names
========

Field Name Standards
-----

!!! note
	Standards are to be considered manadatory conventions

**1.**  Only use lower case characters ("first\_name" instead of "FirstName")

**2.**  Avoid special characters except underscores ("first\_name" instead of "first name")

**3.**  Use underscores to separate words in a field name ("destination\_port" instead of "destinationport")

**4.**  Due to individuals abbreviating differently, do not use abbreviations ("source\_port" instead of "src\_port")

**5.**  Always use singular forms not plural ("message" instead of "messages")

**6.**  Use proper spelling of words

**7.**  IP address fields must end with "\_ip" (this is for dynamic mapping)

**8.**  All IP addresses will receive GeoIP lookups for geo and ASN, which will be added to a corresponding "\*\_geo" field (i.e. "source\_ip" will derive "source\_geo")

**9.**  All IP addresses must be added to the ips array

**10.** All user fields must be added to the users array (field data from fields such as "user", "source\_user", "destination\_user" should be added to users array)

Field Name Guidelines
-----

!!! note
	Guidelines are suggested conventions to adopt, but not as critical as the standards listed above.

**1.**  Use present tense unless field describes historical information (Example: end of connection recording "bytes\_received")

**2.**  Always use singular forms not plural ("message" instead of "messages")

**Exception:** When describing something that is past tense and the expectation is for multiple values ("bytes\_received" instead of "byte\_received")

**3.**  Whenever possible rename fields to match consistent names so long as renaming the field does not cause the event to lose context
    (Example: "unauthorized\_user" may be able to be renamed to "user" if the only event that contains the field "unauthorized\_user" has another field that provides the context of a failed login)

**4.**  Whenever possible, rename field names with the same purpose to one field name ("SrcIP", "SourceIP", "src\_ip", should be consolidated to "source\_ip")

Common field name replacements
-----
