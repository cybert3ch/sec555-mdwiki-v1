Beats
========
Abstract
---------
Beats is a log agent framework designed by Elastic. Because it is a framework it allows for rapid creation of new, purpose built log agents. Elastic currently supports multiple beats agents such as:

- Winlogbeat - This agent is useful for collection Windows logs.
- Filebeat - This agent is useful for monitoring and collecting log files. Because of this it is commonly used to collect standard Linux/Unix logs.
- Packetbeat - This agent is useful to monitor and generate logs from network data. It commonly is deployed on a system that uses a promiscuous NIC configuration with data being mirrored to it either with a network tap or port mirroring.
