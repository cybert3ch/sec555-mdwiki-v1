### Bio
 
John is a SANS instructor and co-author of SEC455 - SIEM Design and Implementation. He is a dedicated blue-teamer and is driven to help develop defensive talent around the world. Through his years of experience as the SOC Lead for GlaxoSmithKline, he has real-world, first-hand knowledge of what it takes to defend an organization against advanced cyber-attacks and is eager to share these lessons with his students. As a SANS Cyber Defense curriculum instructor and course author of SEC455, John specializes in threat hunting, network security monitoring, SIEM design and optimization, and constructing defensive postures that allow organizations to protect their most sensitive data. Throughout class, he works with students to explain difficult concepts in relatable and clear language, illustrates important ideas with stories and demonstrations, and encourages students to push themselves beyond the limit of what they thought possible.

John holds degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering and his past research spans from malware reverse-engineering to car hacking, mobile app security, and IoT devices. In his free time, John enjoys catching every infosec conference he can attend, FPV drone racing, coffee roasting, and slowly turning his home into a data center. He can be found on LinkedIn and on Twitter @SecHubb.
