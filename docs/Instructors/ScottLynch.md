### Bio
 
When Scott left active duty he joined a P-3 squadron to enjoy the benefits of being an aviator while working full time at a Satellite Communications company based out of Philadelphia. Part of the lure of coming to Universal Space Network was the founder, Charles "Pete" Conrad, Apollo 12 Astronaut and third man to walk on the moon. The enticement of getting to continue to travel the world working at remote satellite ground stations whilst being a part of the space program marked the beginning of a 20-year career working in everything from ground station antennaes, satellite operations, to mission integration and launch support operations.

This lead to working in IT security permanently over 10 years ago. Since coming on board at Universal Space Network, the company was acquired by its new patent Swedish Space Corporation where Scott spends his time working as the global Security Operations manager for a truly global satellite communications network. Scott manages the CSIRT team and SOC for SSC in support of our global customer base from NASA, ESA, DoD and beyond. Scott has also been a Cisco Instructor for over 10 years teaching the next generation of network engineers. When Scott is not traveling the world for SSC he loves to spend time with his family.
